## Interviews

### What do you hope to learn from these interviews?
I hope to learn about how a prospective user would want to use an interface to manage their daily spiritual time. I want to know what features should be included and how I can help them with their needs.

### Questions:

- **What are some activities you do when doing daily spiritual time?**
  - Olivia: Olivia said she likes to pray first. Then she likes to journal in like a letter format to god. She usually reflects on her day and thank God. 
  - Carson: Carson said he usually likes to read his bible first. Then he likes to pray. Then finally he journals about both the reading and prayer. 

- **What are some needs around seeing your previous entries?**
  - Olivia: Olivia talked about how she would like to see entries from the past because she wants to see what she was writing on big days in her life. I beleive this means she would like to go very far in the past, and that is her need. She also wanted to be able to lookup journal entries by writing key words, to be able to look if she journaled about something in the past.
  - Carson: Carson said he would not really look at his previous entries that much. But it wouldn't be a useless thing. He talked about how it would be cool if he could log what parts of the bible he read so that he knows how much of it he's read.

- **How often would you view previous entries?**
  - Olivia: About once a month.
  - Carson: Not much. But would use the verse/reading tracker, whenever he wasn't sure what to read next.

- **What specifically do you want to track?**
  - Olivia: Journal entries and how often, to keep herself accountable.
  - Carson: Parts of the bible read and how often to also keep himself accountable.

- **What do you usually journal on?**
  - Olivia: Letter format to god. About her day and writes prayers.
  - Carson: Reflection on verse he read and prayer for the day.

- **Would you prefer a minimalist or feature-rich application?**
  - Olivia: Minimalist so that she doesn't get distracted.
  - Carson: Doesn't care much but wants verse tracker.

- **What types of goals would you set for yourself using a tool like this?**
  - Olivia: Consistency.
  - Carson: Reading entire books and consistency. 

- **What are your favorite themes to use? (dark mode, light mode, a color, etc.)**
  - Olivia: light mode or pink
  - Carson: dark mode or purple

### Findings (What did you learn from them?)
- I learned the activities that they wanted to focus on. These were Journaling, keeping track of verses, prayer, and reflection. Thankfully they were the similar to the ones I made for assignment 2.
- I learned the goals they would like to track. These were consistency and verses read.
- I learned wat type of interface they would want. Simplistic with dark, light, pink, and purple color themes.
- I learned how often and what they want to see when they view previous entries. 

## Design Goals and Requirements

- **To address in implementation**
  - Quickly being able to see their consistency.
  - Being able to switch themes between dark, light, pink, and purple.
  - Journaling, keeping track of verses, prayer, and reflection activities.
  - Viewing previous journal entries.
  - Journal entry search bar ( this is my Level 4 Implementation Goal ).

### Sketching Design Alternatives
I did 10-plus-10 MINUTES, because I was having trouble coming up with more ideas. It said this was allowed in the project instructions.

- **3 interesting design challenges to explore and 10-plus-10 sketches.**
  - Enable the user to select previous entries by date.

### Prototype Sketch of Your Envisioned Interface
- TODO

### Feedback for Prototype Sketches from 2 People
- Olivia: TODO
- Carson: TODO

### Mock User Profile
- Brief description of them.
- How they would use this application.
- TODO 

## Description of the interface in detail:
TODO

### features and controls
- Include plenty of screenshots to illustrate your interface and different actions users can perform within it
- TODO 

### Implementation of this application 
- Explain how you implemented this application (libraries, code structure....)
- TODO

### Use of AI
- Optional- Use of AI-  If you used AI, describe how.  Did you identify strengths/limitations of using AI for your application. Tell your reader how you used an AI tool to help you with your project. Note limitations and places where the AI responses were insufficient.  Comment on whether it was helpful and how.  
- I used AI to convert this documentation from a word document to markdown
- TODO 
    
### Future Work
- Future work- No project is ever fully done. What would you do next?  This is also a place to discuss the work you attempted but could not fully complete before the project deadline- include screenshots to illustrate and document your progress. 
- A verse / what I've read tracker. I belive this would be a large undertaking and would be out of scopr for this project. Might explore if I have time 
- TODO

### Demo Video
- Include a 2-3 minute demo video, showing your interface in action. 
- The easiest way to record this is with a screen capture tool, which also captures audio- such as Quicktime.  Use a voiceover to explain your application.  Include the name of the project, your name, the project components, and how your application works.  You can present it on your webpage or on youtube, but it must be linked on your webpage.
